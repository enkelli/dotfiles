Configuration files for the Vim editor.

## Plugin

I install these plugins using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

* [Command-T](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) - fast "fuzzy" mechanism
  for opening files and more.
* [vim-bracketed-paste](https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste) - transparent pasting into vim
* [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) - easily delete, change and add surroundings
